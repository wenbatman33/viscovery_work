# Vidya Development Guide

## Flow
* Develop Component
* Demo Page
* Write Document
* Link Title of Component Set in Demo Page(playground) to Document

## Should...
* try using html tag on pure text in react component for right text style

`render(<div>foo</div>)` -> `render(<div><p>foo</p></div>)`
* consider every non-fill `props` scenarios(maybe propTypes is not enough)
* know whether the component is fluid or fixed-size(especially `width`)
* make your component as simple as possible
